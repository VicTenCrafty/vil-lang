# Vil - your easy go-to powerful programming language

Vil is a **novice** level programming language, designed to be **easy-to-learn**, allowing you to prototype and make complex programs in minutes!

## Reasons to use Vil:

- **Easy syntax**: If you are familiar with just about any language's syntax like Python, Lua, Java, C#, etc, learning Vil will be a breeze!
- **Uncomplicated convenient package manager**: Like Python's PIP or Rust's cargo? Then you will like VilFetch, a package manager that allows you to install libraries and publish your own in a few minutes!
- **Built-in libraries for all your needs**: Vil comes with tons of libraries to minimize the need of 3rd party tools, such as **sys**, a library including math functions, basic system interaction, file managing, and more, as well as Vil3D, a built-in library with high capabilities for 3D rendering and development!
- **Cross-Platform compability**: Vil has installers for and is compatible with Linux, MacOS, and Windows.


## Vil code demonstration

**Still not convinced? Here is an example of code that shows you how easy Vil is to learn, how fast and how powerful it is!**

**import sys**

**UserInput = input("What do you wanna say? ")**
**sys.output(UserInput)**

## Installing Vil

Vil is easy to set up with our pre-built installer, adding the necessary binaries to path and setting everthing up in minutes!

To get started, install Vil with the Add to PATH option (requires administrator permissions) and create a file ending in .vil, code, and use the `vil <file_name>` command to run it!

**Happy coding in Vil!**
